## Hi there 👋

**Welcome to Cludus**

🙋‍♀️ Cludus is a space to capture software engineering best practices, to do infrastructure automation, and to test and deploy modern technologies for data processing and cloud systems.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - The general philosophy is that every member of this team has access to all resources and can learn the structure of the entire space. Everybody can run all the software locally, find bugs, and create new features. We try to make every desired functionality in our repos to be automatically tested except when automated tests are not technically possible.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - TODO link to architecture explanation here.
